# Intrinsic factorization of ideals in Dedekind domains

We present a generalization of a polynomial factorization algorithm that works with
ideals in maximal orders of global function fields. The method presented in this paper is intrinsic
in the sense that it does not depend on the embedding of the ring of polynomials into the Dedekind
domain in question. 

The authors implemented algorithms described in this paper in a computer algebra system Magma.
We also preset two examples computed using our implementation.
